## Database Type Filter

This filter, which is a type of chart in Superset, was designed to be used in the dashboard aiming the filtering of the data based on the field ''database_type'' from the table ''data_source''. It is important to give the alias ''Type'' to this field in the select operations because Superset does not recognize as the same field otherwise.

### SQL query

```sql
--  Country and database type filters
SELECT source.name, 
       country.country AS Country, 
       database_type AS Type,
       source.slug
FROM public.data_source AS source INNER JOIN public.country 
    AS country ON source.country_id=country.id;
```
