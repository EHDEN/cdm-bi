Automated Characterization of Health Information at Large-scale Longitudinal Evidence Systems (ACHILLES) is a profiling tool developed by the OHDSI community to provide descriptive statistics of databases standardized to the OMOP Common Data Model. These characteristics are presented graphically in the ATLAS tool. However, this solution does not allow for database comparison across the data network. The Data Network Dashboards aggregates ACHILLES results files from databases in the network and displays the descriptive statistics through graphical dashboards. This tool is helpful to gain insight in the growth of the data network and is useful for the selection of databases for specific research questions. In the software demonstration we show a first version of this tool that will be further developed in EHDEN in close collaboration with all our stakeholders, including OHDSI.


## Contributors {-}

To develop this tool, EHDEN organized a hack-a-thon (Aveiro, December 2-3, 2019), where we defined and implemented a series of charts and dashboards containing the most relevant information about the OMOP CDM databases. The team involved in this task were composed by the following members:

* João Rafael Almeida^1^
* André Pedrosa^1^
* Peter R. Rijnbeek^2^
* Marcel de Wilde^2^
* Michel Van Speybroeck^3^
* Maxim Moinat^4^
* Pedro Freire^1^
* Alina Trifan^1^
* Sérgio Matos^1^
* José Luís Oliveira^1^
