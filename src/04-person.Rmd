## Label Colors 

In order to obtain the colours blue and rose in the chart representing the gender distribution,
add the following JSON entry to the JSON object of the `JSON Metadata` field on the edit dashboard page:

```json
"label_colors": {
    "Male": "#3366FF", 
    "Female": "#FF3399"
}
```

## CSS

To hide the dashboard header insert the following css code to the `CSS` field on the edit page:

```css
.dashboard > div:not(.dashboard-content) {  /* dashboard header */
  display: none;
}
```

## Data Source Filter

```{r dataSourceFilter, fig.cap="Settings for creating the Data Source filter chart",echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/shared/data_source_filter.png")
```

**For the filter to work the name of the fields to filter should match in all tables used on the charts of this dashboard.**

### SQL query
