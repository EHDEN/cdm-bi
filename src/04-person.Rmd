In this dashboard is present the ''Database Type Filter'', that was detailed in the Chapter General. Besides, it was necessary to customize the dashboard JSON Metadata in order to obtain the colours blue and rose in the chart representing the gender distribution. Therefore, the following entry should be added in the settings of this dashboard:

```json
"label_colors": {
    "Male": "#3366FF", 
    "Female": "#FF3399"
}
```
